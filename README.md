# Python List Operations

This project demonstrates various list operations in Python. The following operations are performed:

1. **Create an empty list** called `my_list`.
2. **Append values** to the list: 10, 20, 30, and 40.
3. **Insert a value** at the second position in the list (value 15).
4. **Extend the list** by adding another list: [50, 60, 70].
5. **Remove the last element** from the list.
6. **Sort the list** in ascending order.
7. **Find the index** of the value `30` and print it.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x

## Example Output

Final sorted list: [10, 15, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70] Index of 30: 3

## How to Run

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Run the Python script `list_operations.py`.
3. See the printed output in the console.
